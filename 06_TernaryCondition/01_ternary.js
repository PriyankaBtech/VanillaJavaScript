// ternary operator / ternary condition

// work same as ==> else if statement
// syntax ==> condition ? true statment : false statment


//Example
let num1 = 10
let num2 = 5

//(num1 > num2) ? console.log("a is Greater") : console.log("b is Greater")

//Example

let num = 0
num == 0 
? console.log("The number is Zero")
: num > 0
? console.log("The number is greater than Zero")
: console.log("The number is lesser than Zero")
// The number is Zero


//Example

let number1 = 10
let number2 = 10

number1 == number2
? console.log("Both the numbers are equal")
: number1 > number2
? console.log(`The large number among the two number is ${number1}`)
: console.log(`The large number among the numbers is ${number2}`)
// Both the numbers are equal
